 Functionalities to Build On:

  Core DSP:
  1. [DONE] Multiple clipping algorithms - tanh, arctan, cubic, hard clip
  2. [DONE] Input/Output gain - control how hard you drive into the clipper
  3. [DONE] Threshold control - where clipping starts
  4. [DONE] Mix (dry/wet) - blend processed/unprocessed signal
  5. [DONE] Oversampling (1x, 2x, 4x) - anti-aliasing filters, latency compensated

  Stereo Features:
  6. Stereo link toggle - clip based on max(L,R) vs independent
  7. Mid-Side mode - process M/S separately

  Quality/Polish:
  8. DC blocking filter - remove DC offset before/after clipping
  9. Auto-gain compensation - maintain perceived loudness
  10. Input/output metering - VU or peak meters
  11. Visualization - show transfer curve or waveform
  12. Output ceiling / limiter stage
